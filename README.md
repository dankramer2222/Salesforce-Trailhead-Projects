# Salesforce Trailhead Projects 🚀

Welcome! This repository is a personal learning showcase of my journey through **Salesforce Trailhead**, focusing on the **Salesforce Administrator** career path.  
I’m documenting each hands-on task with step-by-step guides using [Scribe](https://scribehow.com/), making the content both practical and easy to follow.
