# 🚀 Salesforce Admin Hands-On Showcase

Welcome to my Salesforce Admin showcase — a **practical portfolio** where I demonstrate real-world Salesforce configurations, automation, and admin tasks.  
This is more than just a study log — it's a **working collection** of hands-on experience built during my journey through [Salesforce Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com).
